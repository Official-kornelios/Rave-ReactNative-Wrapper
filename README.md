# Rave By Flutterwave React Native Web View Component
This is the react native SDK for Rave By [Flutterwave.](https://rave.flutterwave.com) that utilizes webview in displaying the Rave modal

This SDK allows you plug-in Rave's payment gateway directly into your react native application and start accepting payment immediately, utilizing all avaliable payment methods, by setting the payment method you want from your Rave Dashboard

This package copies a similar loading design to that of Rave, which makes transistion to Rave's website less noticeable. This package also offers a cancel button, so one can easily cancel if Rave takes a long time to load its content (the ``` onCancel ``` props event is called when this happens).
